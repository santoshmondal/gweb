Step1::To make an action to be the default action with application name in struts2. Figure out the action which you want
to make the default action. Lets assume the name of the action is 'hello'.
Step2::Next we need to make an entry into the web.xm file under tag welcome-file-list as following:
	<welcome-file-list>
		<welcome-file>/struts2/hello.action</welcome-file>
	</welcome-file-list>
Keep in mind here the name of the action is the default action. 

STEP3::Now make sure one dummy file with the 'hello.action' exist in your web application folder in the specified path. 

Thats it!!!
